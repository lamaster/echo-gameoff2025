# ((( E C H O ))) — Game Off “Waves”
Sound-first maze runner built for the Game Off jam 2025

---
You’re dropped into a dark labyrinth with only sound and fading rings of light to navigate. Ping the space, listen to echoes, follow afterglow waves, and escape before your charges or time run out.
---

## Theme
Waves

## Core loop
Move through the maze, fire sonic pings, watch the expanding rings on the floor/minimap, and use stereo echoes to sense walls and openings.

## Objectives
Reach the exit; later stages add keys and beacon cues, with a bonus hard mode that limits pings and adds a timer.

## Controls
- Mouse: look (pointer lock grabs the cursor while focused)
- `W A S D`: move
- `Shift`: sprint
- `Space`: jump
- `X`: ping (consumes a charge, regenerates over time)
- `Esc`: release pointer lock
